#Summary
Here's a bit about myself,

Being a graduate from General Assembly in there Web Development Immersive program I was able to learn the basics of becoming a Full Stack Developer. I still don't know if that is the exact path I want to take so I just call myself a Web Developer. 

I decided to today November 3rd that I will be taking part in a 100 days of code challenge for myself to become organized and also have motivation to keep on coding with new ideas. I am still lacking in some ways but I plan on getting better.

I am going to start off the 100 days with workin on a React and Redux tutorial. I will share the link below of which tutorial I am using. For an hour or maybe more, depending how I feel I will be working on here until I complete this tutorial and move on to something else after.
